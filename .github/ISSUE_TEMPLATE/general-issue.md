Dear ES-DOC user,

We are keen to receive and respond to any questions, requests or reports of problems you may wish to register with us.

We have a closely-monitored email account designed as a dedicated channel for ES-DOC support.

**Please contact us at this support email, [support@es-doc.org](mailto:support@es-doc.org), rather than raising an Issue here**. We promise to respond to emails as soon as practicable, but cannot guarantee to promptly pick up on Issues raised on the issue trackers\*.

Thanks for your understanding,

The ES-DOC team


\*this is because there are hundreds of ES-DOC(-INSTITUTIONAL) repositories for us to manage and it would be difficult to efficiently monitor all of the individual issue trackers.
