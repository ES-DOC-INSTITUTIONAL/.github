## Default guideline files for the ES-DOC(-INSTITUTIONAL) repositories

A special repository to hold guideline files recognised and processed by
GitHub (templates for Issues & PRs, contributing guides, etc.).

If a given ES-DOC(-INSTITUTIONAL) repository does not *itself*
define one of the "community health" files listed here (by the same name),
GitHub will process into that repository the corresponding file from this
repository. See
[this section of the GitHub documentation](
https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file)
for further detail.
