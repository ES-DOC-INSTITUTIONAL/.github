# ES-DOC: Earth System Documentation

### About ES-DOC

The Earth System Documentation (ES-DOC) project aims to nurture an eco-system
of tools & services in support of Earth System documentation **creation,
analysis and dissemination**. Such an eco-system enables the scientific
community to better understand & utilize Earth system model data.

ES-DOC is coordinated with other community efforts such as
[CMIP](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip) and
[ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov/) via the World Climate Research Programme
work group on Climate Modelling
([WGCM](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/)) and its Infrastructure Panel
([WIP](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip/wip)).


## About this organisation

This GitHub organisation (*ES-DOC-INSTITUTIONAL*) is used as a
home to contain all of the defined ES-DOC institutional GitHub
repositories, with one repository per participating institution.

Repository names are institution identifiers, for example for
the institutions participating in CMIP6 they are the abbreviations
defined by the
[CMIP6 Core Controlled Vocabularies (CVs)](https://github.com/WCRP-CMIP/CMIP6_CVs)
as listed
[here](https://github.com/WCRP-CMIP/CMIP6_CVs/blob/master/CMIP6_institution_id.json).

For repositories containing technical infrastructure libraries, archives,
sources of documentation and other related resources, please see the
[*ES-DOC*](https://github.com/ES-DOC) GitHub organisation.
